### Human Activity Recognition using Deep Learning

ABLSTM model for Wifi CSI based Human Activity Recognition - [Report](pdf/HAR_Wifi_report.pdf)

I have attempted to reproduce the results in the WiFi CSI Based Passive Human Activity Recognition Using Attention Based BLSTM using a publicly available dataset. The process involves the re-implementation of the Attention Based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory method in the original study. My algorithmâ€™s results align with the claims in the original paper.

### Reproduce Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Object Counting

This is my reimplementation of an Adversarial Domain adaption model for the task of object counting. This is a general domain adaptation framework and it could be applicable for other vision tasks as well.

### [Flicker Stimulator](https://github.com/bobvo23/flicker_stimulator) (25 stars - Github)

SSVEP Stimulator using MATLAB and Psychtoolbox

This is a 4 classes (or more) flickering stimulator for Steady State Evoked Potential experiment. The software generates four different target as can be seen in this video.Â [Youtube demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HriCj1_7jdI)Â This tool presents a stable flickering frequencies which are usable for BCI applications.

### [WEEGEE Project](https://github.com/bobvo23/WEEG_SigPro)

[Master thesis](pdf/master_thesis.pdf)
This is the thesis project for my Master in Biomedical Engineering.

WEEG is a 24-bit 8-channel EEG system with integrated hardware and software interface. The device is based a new system-on-a-chip (SoC) to reduce circuitry components and be cost effective. Real-time view of 8-channel EEG data is also displayed.
